#1. Create a for loop with variable i that counts down from 5 to 1 and then prints "Hello World!"
#at the end.

#2. Create a for loop that counts up and prints only even numbers between 1 and 30.

#3. Create a for loop that prints from 1 to 30 and continues (skips the number) if the number is
#divisible by 3.

#4. Create a for loop that prints 5 different animals from a list.

#5. Create a for loop that spells out a word you input backwards.
#(HINT: Google "How to reverse a string in Python")

#6. Create a list containing 10 integers of your choice and print the list.

#7. Create two empty variables named evenNumbers and oddNumbers.

#8. Make a loop that counts the number of even and odd numbers in the list, and prints the
#result after the loop.

#9. Create a variable that asks the user for an integer and an empty integer variable.

#10. Create a loop with a range from 1 to the number the user input. Use the loop to find the
#factorial of that number and print the result. A factorial of a number is that number multiplied
#by every number before it until you reach 1. (For example: 5! is 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120)
