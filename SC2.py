#A local health clinic is looking to add a quick BMI calculator to their website so that their
#patients can quickly input their height and weight and be given a number as well as their
#classification. The classifications are as follows:

# - Underweight: Less than 18.5 BMI
# - Normal Weight: 18.5 to 24.9 BMI
# - Overweight: 25 to 29.9 BMI
# - Obese: 30 or more BMI

#It is up to you to figure out the calculation for an accurate BMI reading and tying it to
#the right classification
