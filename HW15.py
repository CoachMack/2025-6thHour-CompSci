#7. Print the 4th number in the list.

#8. Append another integer to the end of the list, also random from 1 to 10.

#9. Sort the list from lowest to highest and then print the 4th number in the list again.

#10. Create a while loop that starts at 1, prints i and then adds i to itself until it is greater than 100.

#11. Create a list containing the names of five other students in the classroom.

#12. Create a for loop that individually prints out the names of each student in the list.
